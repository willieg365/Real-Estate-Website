        <h1>Market Evaluation Tools</h1>
        <p>There are lots of home valuation tools online, but these all produce ballpark figures based on data scraped together from several public sometimes unreliable sources.</p>
        <h1>Best Practice for Finding Your Home Value</h1>
          <p>For the most accurate and up-to-date home value, there is simply no substitute for the expertise of a real estate agent - <a href="contact.html">like me</a> - who’s In The Know®. I have access to decades of data through the Multiple Listing Service(MLS), which tracks every detail of home listings and sales over the past several decades. That means my team can make suggestions based on historical data and current market patterns.</p>
